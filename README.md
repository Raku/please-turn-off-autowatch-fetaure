# GitHub's Autowatch Feature

By default github will automatically watch repositories that you have
access to. Most of the time we're very permissive and would love to
see your contributions, which is why we give access to most of the
repos. However, this means that you will suddenly watch hundreds of
repositories, and you will start receiving email notifications for all
changes that are happening (believe me, there are lots of changes and
discussions going on!). To prevent that, please do the following:

1. Go to [Settings/Notifications](https://github.com/settings/notifications).
2. Uncheck the “Automatically watch repositories” feature.
3. Done!

Thank you!
